%%The goal of this work is to provide a self-contained, easy-to-use LaTeX package that eases the typesetting of cP systems, a variant of Membrane Computing/P systems created by Dr. Radu Nicolescu and collaborators in the early 2010s.  Please refer to the package documentation for instructions on its use.  To the best of my knowledge, it is compatible with all LaTeX2e distributions which are reasonably up-to-date, as well as all classes (and likely all or almost all packages) that are typically used for publishing material on P systems.

%%This work consists of the file cpsystems.dtx, cpsystems.ins and their derived products cpsystems.sty, cpsystems.pdf and this README.  The `canonical' version of this work is currently to be found at https://github.com/jcoo092/LaTeX-cP-systems/
%%
%%Constructive pull requests, creation of issues for bugs, and suggestions for improvements are very welcome.
%%
%%This package was originally created to assist me while writing a paper on cP systems which also largely re-appears in my PhD dissertation.  While you are certainly free to peruse and use this package, if you don't know what Membrane Computing/P systems is, this package is unlikely to be of much use to you.
