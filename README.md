# LaTeX-cP-systems
A LaTeX package to aid typesetting of cP systems, a Membrane Computing variant created by Nicolescu &amp; collaborators

To use this package, either install the sty file to your local LaTeX distribution's package repository (please refer to your distribution's documentation for more details on this), or simply include the .sty file in the top level of the document you are current working on.  If you are using Overleaf or a similar online editor, the latter option will probably be required, since this package isn't currently available on CTAN.
